# Plan: Document section subjects

Status: Implemented; hosted integration pending
Spec: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Design and constitution

Keep browser HTTP in stateless adapters, sections request state in a root store,
and presentation driven by typed inputs. The wizard orchestrates section loading
with destroy cleanup; form payload explicitly includes ID and title. Catalog
filters derive subjects from loaded definitions, display titles and compare IDs.
Document HTTP uses /api/documents in production, localhost:3007 in development.

The assessment service replaces subject enums/unions with validated strings,
adds optional title inputs/defaulted title storage for old clients, and groups
learner subjects from definitions/attempts. All identity/progression queries remain
string-based. Title updates never affect identity. Generate contract types from
DTO source; use a local vendored archive for consumer verification, not publication.

No constitution deviations. No other service collections, data migration, auth,
scoring, lifecycle, route or federation changes. Subject options are not server
foreign-key validation; the service validates shape and stores the snapshot.

## Verification

Service disposable Mongo HTTP tests cover Rust round-trip, title rename with same
ID, duplicate detection, start/eligibility and invalid IDs/titles plus existing
regressions. Admin tests cover dynamic choices, states/retry, payload mapping,
existing selection and title display/filtering. Build source, generated contracts
and production admin; check source organization.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript ~5.9.3 / Angular 21.1
**Primary Dependencies**: Angular Material, RxJS, generated assessment DTOs
**Storage**: Service-owned data; scoped unsaved form/view state
**Project Type**: Federated standalone Angular remote
